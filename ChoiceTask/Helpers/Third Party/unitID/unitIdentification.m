% THE SPIKE TIMES MUST BE SORTED IN ASCENDING ORDER!!!  Failure to do this
% will cause unpredictable results.
%
% You will need to compile relativeHist.c
%
% Each argument is a #days x 1 cell array where each element represents one
% day of recording.
% 
% channel{day}: #neurons vector of channel numbers
% unit{day}: #neurons vector of sort id numbers, would be between 1 and
%   4 if your system has the capacity to sort 4 neurons on each channel.
% spiketimes{day}: #neurons cell array of #spikes vector of spike
%   times.  spiketimes{day}{i} would be the vector of spiketimes for
%   channel{day}{i} unit number unit{day}{i}.
% wmean{day}: #neurons cell array of #samples vector representing a mean
%   waveform.  wmean{day}{i} would be the mean waveform for channel{day}{i}
%   unit number unit{day}{i}.
%
% [survival] indicates where the same neuron survives from day to
%   day.  survival{d}(i,j) == 1 if the i'th unit on day d represents the same
%   neuron as the j'th unit on day d+1.
%
% [score] is the posterior probability of being the same neuron according
%   to the Gaussian mixture model-based classifier.
%
% [corrscore] is the value for pairwise correlation score for identity
%   computed in the last iteration, which you will need if you want to make
%   plots of the parameters used for classification.
%
% [wavescore, autoscore, basescore, correlations] can be fed directly to
%   iterateSurvival to save time if for some reason you need to run the
%   algorithm again with exactly the same parameters.
%
% Options:
% 'plot': call gaussianMix at the end, which makes a fancy plot of some of
%   the similarity scores
% 'dickey': Compute autocorrelation similarity using the method of Dickey, 
%   A. S., A. Suminski, et al. (2009). J Neurophysiol 102(2).
% 
% Warnings: 
%
% It is important that the spiketimes vectors represent contiguous
% recordings.  If there are gaps in your data you need to excise them so
% that spiketimes represents a pseudo-continuous recording.  This is
% necessary because the mean firing rate of each neuron is calculated as
% length(spiketimes{day}{i})/range(spiketimes{day}{i}).  
%
% If you give this algorithm units that are poorly discriminated, it will
% make a best effort but the results will be somewhat ill-defined due to
% the fact that some sorted units may be combinations of multiple neurons
% with the combination changing from day to day.  Having said that, the
% algorithm is fairly robust to this assumption so you should not feel that
% everything needs to be perfectly isolated.  A good criterion is that if
% you feel confident a sorted unit is >90% from one neuron then it should
% be included.
%
% This function can be very memory-intensive if you feed it a lot of data
% at once.  For every gigabyte of memory you have you should be able to do
% at least 10 sessions with 100 neurons/session.
%
% IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU MINIMIZE THE PRESENCE OF MOTION ARTIFACT
% AND ELECTRICAL CROSS-TALK IN YOUR DATA.  If the same unit is being
% recorded on multiple channels, or if there is heavy motion artifact
% causing simultaneous spikes on many channels, this will screw up the
% cross-correlation based classifier.  Occasional motion artifact is
% acceptable as long as it represents a negligable portion of the overall
% spikes.  If you suspect that motion artifact is causing problems in your
% data you should turn on the 'plot' option and look at the distribution of
% pairwise scores.  If the blue distribution is significantly away from zero
% for the pairwise scores then there may be something funny going on.
