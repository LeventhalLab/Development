- Found movement times and reaction times are not generally bimodal, only true for R0088 20151102a
- Found that firing rate modulation is not purely from low-IS (<7ms) spiking by subtracting tsISI from ts in event analysis
[ ] Carefully characterize firing at centerOut event to better understand if it's bursting or just fast-firing
[ ] Visualize movement time vs. some firing metric to lay that theory to rest
^ this could be a stacked 2D line/area graph of ISI (or diff(ts)) or spikeDensityEstimate

[?] Look again at the finding that RT correlates with high beta power events (sort lfpRaster by MT)
^ [?] confirm that MT is bimodal (for all sessions)

- Found that the largest beta oscillations are locked to the centerOut event
- Found that bursting is visible in event-triggered spike rasters for centerOut event
^ this suggests that there should be way of correlating bursting and beta, at least during centerOut
- Found a small set of units that fired very periodically (9-10 Hz) during high beta power epochs
^ after reviewing those timestamps compared with the video they all (8-9 time points) occur while the rat is waiting for the cue ("focusing")
