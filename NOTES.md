- Found that the largest beta oscillations are locked to the centerOut event
- Found that bursting is visible in event-triggered spike rasters for centerOut event
^ this suggests that there should be way of correlating bursting and beta, at least during centerOut
- Found a small set of units that fired very periodically (9-10 Hz) during high beta power epochs
^ after reviewing those timestamps compared with the video they all (8-9 time points) occur while the rat is waiting for the cue ("focusing")
